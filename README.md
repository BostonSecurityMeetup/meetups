## Welcome!
#### Hello! Welcome to BSM!

We are a group of security folks in the Boston area. We meet monthly for a few hours. We have a mix of panels, talks and group discussions. We favor technical or practical topics and have a strong no sales pitch policy. You can see our past talks [here](2018).

If you'd like to suggest a topic or give a talk feel free to create an issue with a summary and we'll work with you to figure out when we can schedule you in.
